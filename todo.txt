- click the play pile to clear it to the discard pile
- deal into piles in the middle so people can take a pile after seeing the top card, caps style
- trade with players (when a trading checkbox is ticked, clicking a card will send it to that player
- display a log of who played what cards/who drew/who traded
- eventually use that log to be able to undo moves
- gray out "join" after you've joined
- enable "start game" after four people are there
- hide "deal" until everyone's connected
